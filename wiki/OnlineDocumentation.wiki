= How to use this extension =

This is a XML-style extension to show charts by using the google chart API. It takes the data to show between {{{<lines>}}} and {{{</lines>}}} ({{{<bars>}}} and {{{<pie>}}} are also possible tags for charts). Just put one value per row:

If you put this code in a page of your wiki

{{{
<lines title="Site Visitors">
5345
3452
7843
</lines>
}}}

you will get this chart:

== Setting the Y-Axis ==

By default the Y-Axis gets autoscaled by finding the greatest and the smallest value of all given data. If you would like to set the Y-Axis manually you can do so by using {{{ymin}}} and {{{ymax}}} (You don´t have to use both values):

{{{
<lines title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=8000>
5345
3452
7843
</lines>
}}}

== Showing multiple data-lines ==

You can show multiple data lines in a chart if you put multiple values separated by a colon in each row: 

{{{
<lines title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=8000>
4115,1230
2541,911
5410,2433
</lines>
}}}

To separate the data lines in a better way you can set the color of each line:

{{{
<lines title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=8000 colors=FF0000,00FF00>
4115,1230
2541,911
5410,2433
</lines>
}}}

== Putting Labels on the X-axis ==

If you add the *xlabel*-parameter to the chart, the first column of the given data is handled as labels for the X-axis:

{{{
<lines title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=8000 colors=FF0000,00FF00 xlabel>
Oct,4115,1230
Nov,2541,911
Dec,5410,2433
</lines>
}}}

== Adding a legend to the chart ==

Especially for charts with multiple data lines you should add a legend to it. This can be done with the *ylabel*-parameter and putting the labels for the legend in the first row of the content.

{{{
<lines title="Site Visitors" ymin=0 ymax=8000 colors=FF0000,00FF00 xlabel ylabel>
   ,EU,US
Oct,4115,1230
Nov,2541,911
Dec,5410,2433
</lines>
}}}

*Note:* _As you see in the example, if you also have labels on the X-axis, the first column of the first row is empty!_

= parameters common to all types of charts =

  * by default the size of the y-axis is determined by the smallest and the biggest value in the chart. if you would like to set it manually use *ymin* and *ymax*: {{{ymin=0}}}
  * you can add a legend to the chart with the *ylabel* parameter and putting the labels in the first row of the content.
  * if you add the *xlabel*-parameter, the first column of the content is considered as labels for the X-axis.
  * *size* takes the size of the chart as additional parameter (Default is {{{size=200x120}}}).
  * *title* is used to set the title of a chart (e.g. {{{title=”site visitors”}}}
  * with *colors* you can set the color for the chart in RRGGBB-style (like _FF0000_ for red). If you have multiple data columns separate the colors with a colon.
  * By default the field separator is ",". If you would like to have a different separator set it with *fieldsep*: {{{fieldsep=”;”}}}
  * You can set the chart background with the *fill*-parameter. Please see http://code.google.com/apis/chart/#chart_or_background_fill for details.

== parameters for bar-charts ==

  * add *horizontal* if you would like to have to bars displayed horinzontal.
  * if you show multiple data columns in a chart you can use the *stacked*-parameter to show them stacked and not side by side.

== parameters for pie-charts ==
  * use *3d* if you want to show a 3d-style pie-chart.
